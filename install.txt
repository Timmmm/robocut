INSTALLATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^

sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev git-core

# Go to home directory (or wherever you want to install it)
cd ~
# Get the latest source code (if you don't already have it)
git clone git://gitorious.org/robocut/robocut.git

# Go into the source code directory.
cd robocut

# Build the project.
qmake
make

# At this point the executable is built, and you can just link to it if you like, or you can install it
# system-wide like this:
sudo cp Robocut /usr/local/bin



# Then create a link in your menu to /usr/local/bin/Robocut  (not capital R)


# Finally remember to make sure you are in the lp group:

adduser <you> lp

# You will probably have to log out and log in again after that.
